The code has a random output of negative or positive numbers between -1000000 and 1000000, because we are incrementing and decrementing the same variable simulanously. The threads fetch the variable from memory, increments/decrements it and stores it back into memory, when one thread is slighty faster/slower than the other, it will be overwritten. This adds up over 1000000 computations and you get the random output.
